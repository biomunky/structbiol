# structbiol

use the namespace
(:use '[structbiol.dssp])

read a dssp file and obtain a DSSP. record
(def dssp (read-dssp "resources/1hnn.dssp"))

There aren't many methods at the moment.  Example -> get chains (filtered to exclude nils)
(chains dssp)
> (A B) ;these a strings

Can break a chain up based on blocks of secondary structure -> H,I,G,E,B,S,T,- (other)

(chunk-chain-by-structure "A" (remove-bad-residues (read-dssp "fullpath-to-file")))

# The above is shown in core.clj
# core.clj is essentially of no use to anyone other than me - unless you change the directory
# to point at a local collection of dssp files
