# structbiol

use the namespace
(:use '[structbiol.dssp])

read a dssp file and obtain a DSSP. record
(def dssp (read-dssp "resources/1hnn.dssp"))

There aren't many methods at the moment.  Example -> get chains (filtered to exclude nils)
(chain-identifiers dssp)
> (A B) ;these a strings

For the moment, you can get secondary structure and sequence using:
(println (map (fn [x] [(:ss x) (:aa x)]) (:atoms dssp)))
This will be for all chains and include gaps - those idenfied as '!*' by 
dssp.  At the moment I am not sure what I am going to do with these positions,
I can't see any use for them at the moment.
